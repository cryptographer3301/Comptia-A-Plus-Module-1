I- MOTHER BOARD - Chipset & Buses
 A- Architecture & Infrastructure:
  - Chipset
    - Intel & AMD
    - Northbridge Memory Display
    - Southbridge I/O 
    - DMI: Direct Media Interface
  - Buses
    - Front side Bus (Intel)
    - Hyper-Transport Bus (AMD)
    - Memory Bus
    - Extension Bus
  - Electronic communication
  
 1- Chipset: 
 - A group of integrated circuits or chips,that are designed to work together and usually    are marketed as a single product.

 - Living on the motherboard, a PC's chipset controls the communication between the CPU, RAM, storage and other peripherals. The chipset determines how many high-speed components or USB devices your best motherboard can support. Chipsets are usually comprised of one to four chips and feature controllers for commonly used peripherals, like the your keyboard, mouseor monitor. Consist from 4 digit code starting with a letter, Z for High end PCs, B & H for typical desktop, Q for higher security business Pcs, and W for workstation .

 2- Bus: One wire or a group of wires that carry data from one palce to another, System that transfers data between components within a computer

 3- Electronic communication: Serial vs Parallel
  - Serial: sending one bit of data at a time
  - Parallel: sending multiple bits of data at a time 
  - Bits & Bytes: 1 byte = 8 bits , 1 bit = 0,125 byte , 1 Mbps = 125 KBps

 4- Lane: Two serial wires that enable the sending and receiving of data simultaneously Receive <----> Sending

II- Chipsets:
  - Two main motherboard chipset manufacturers: INTEL & AMD

  - Two main chips controlling communication on a Pc Motherboard: Northbridge & Southbridge

  - Northbridge: also called memory controller hub MCH, High data transfer devices, High speed graphics, Memory RAM

  - Southbridge: also called I/O Controller hum ICH, secondary controllers, most input output devices, such as Hard drives, USB, Ethernet ...

 - Direct Media Interface: what connects the north with Sidebridge

III- Buses:
 - Front side Bus (Intel) and AMD hypertransport are the same, the only difference is the corset, front side bus let the CPU connect to the northbridge

 - Memory bus connect to the northbridge 

 - Expantion bus: An expansion bus provides an input/output pathway for transferring information between internal hardware, such as RAM or the CPU, and expansion devices such as a graphics card or sound card.

V- Expantion boards, and storage technology
 - There is a multiple type of expantion buses, here some of most important ones:

 - ISA : First introduced in an 8-bit configuration in 1981 and upgraded to 16-bit in 1984, stands for industry standard architecture, An Industry Standard Architecture bus (ISA bus) is a computer bus that allows additional expansion cards to be connected to a computer's motherboard. It is a standard bus architecture for IBM compatibles. Introduced in 1981, the ISA bus was designed to support the Intel 8088 microprocessor for IBMâ€™s first-generation PC.

 - PCI 1992: Peripheral component interconnect: ISA is an old technology that has been replaced by PCI, PCIe and so on. ISA slots are usually black, long and the gold contacts are large. PCI slots are light-colored, usually white, shorter and smaller, ISA operates at 8 MHz clock rate and has a maximum data rate of 8 MBp while PCI operates at clock speeds of 33 or 66 MHz. At 32 bits and 33 MHz, a PCI bus has a maximum data rate of 132 MBps. ISA bus is not used in modern computers, as mentioned before, it was replaced by the PCI, AGP, and USB. ----> PCIe express is a serial bus which connects graphic cards, Wifi, hard drives and other hardware devices. It works faster than PCI, had less input and output pin count making it work better than PCI.
